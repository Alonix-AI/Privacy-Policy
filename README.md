Key Principles

No Collection of Private Wallet Information:

Alonix AI does not collect, store, or access your private wallet keys or any sensitive wallet information.

All transactions and interactions occur directly on the Solana blockchain, ensuring full decentralization and user control.

Our platform leverages the Solana blockchain for all operations, ensuring that no centralized entity has access to your private information.

All data related to transactions is publicly verifiable on the blockchain and does not include sensitive or private user data.

All interactions with Alonix AI are processed via the Solana blockchain, ensuring that every transaction is immutable and transparent.

We utilize secure wallet connections, such as browser-based wallet extensions (e.g., Phantom, Solflare), which operate entirely on your device. Your private keys are never shared with or accessible by Alonix AI.

No Third-Party Tracking or Data Sharing:

Alonix AI does not use cookies, third-party trackers, or any mechanisms to collect or share user data.

We do not sell, trade, or share any information related to your usage of the platform.

Blockchain Transparency

By using Alonix AI, you acknowledge that:

All transactions are publicly recorded on the Solana blockchain.

While blockchain transactions are transparent and verifiable, they do not expose your private wallet keys or other sensitive details.

User Responsibilities
